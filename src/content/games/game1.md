Mario Bros. is a classic arcade game developed and published by Nintendo in 1983. The game features Mario and Luigi, two Italian plumber brothers, as they navigate through platform-filled sewers. Players must defeat various enemies like Shellcreepers and Fighter Flies by hitting the platform beneath them, then kicking them away.

The game established many iconic elements of the Mario franchise:

- Two-player cooperative gameplay
- The signature jumping mechanics
- Coin collection system
- Power-up transformations

Mario Bros. laid the foundation for future Nintendo platformers, particularly Super Mario Bros., which revolutionized the gaming industry in 1985.

## Key Features

- Simple yet addictive gameplay
- Competitive and cooperative modes
- Progressive difficulty system
- Memorable character designs

The game's influence continues to be felt today, with many modern titles incorporating similar cooperative mechanics and platform-based combat systems.
